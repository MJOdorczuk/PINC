## Local adjustments to the makefile can be stored in a file local.mk for which
## this file (local.mk.tmp) is a template. Supported local adjustments are
## indicated below
##

# Which command/program to use to compile and link source code.
# If you do not set this it defaults to 'mpicc'.
#
# CC = mycomplier

# Which optimization flag(s) to use for your compiler. Default is '-O3'.
#
# COPT = -myflag

# Local flags to add to the compiler. Especially useful if you have libraries
# installed in non-standard manners. For instance, you can add -I to add path
# with header files, -L for paths containing libraries, and -l to specify
# library files to use, although for the libraries in use the -l parameters
# are most likely already correctly set in the makefile. For instance, if you
# have a library with header files in /usr/mylib/include/ and the library
# files in /usr/mylib/lib/ then you may want to do like this:
#
# CLOCAL =	-I/usr/mylib/include/	\
#			-L/usr/mylib/lib/		\
#			-I/usr/mylib2/include	\
#			-L/usr/mylib2/lib		\
#			-lgslcblas
